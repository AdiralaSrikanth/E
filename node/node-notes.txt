what is Node js
Before the introduction of node js, at that point javascript really run in browser.
and limited to browser allowed to do. click event to button, redirect user to other page etc
creating webserver, connecting db was not possible
with the introduction of node js, developers can use javascript on the server side,
creating webservers, application backend and command line applications

Summary from nodejs official page. 
Node js is a Javascript runtime built on chromes v8 javascript engine.
every browser has their own js engine. nodejs uses chrome v8 js engine.

Job of any js engine is to take in javascript code and compile to machine code.
v8 is written in c++ lang.
anyone can write c++ app, incorporate v8 javascript engine into their app and
extend the functionalities that JS provide.

chrome and v8 do the same. chrome and nodejs are written in c++.
nodejs is a js runtime. It is not a programming lang. we write js code.

runtime provides custom functionalities- various tools and libraries specific to an environment

chrome provides V8 with various objects and functions. that allow js dev in the chrome browser to do things, add click events and manipulate dom
node doesnt provide those instead
node runtimme provides tools/libraries that node dev need. libraries for setting up server,
integrating with file system so that you can read and write from disc.

At the end of the day, both chrome and node are creating modified version of javascript

chrome browser uses v8 engine. when chrome needs to run a js for a particular webpage it does not run the javascript itself and It can'take
instead it uses v8 engine to get that done.
It passes js code to v8 and it gets the results back.


It is also same with node. node doesnt know how to run js code. it passes to v8 and get the results


v8 does not know how to interact with DOM and filesystem. Its node and chrome job to provide implementations
for those when running v8.


chrome, node are written in C++ its not a coincidence

JS (chrome)             C++
localStorage.getItem   some C++ function
document.querySelector some C++ function

localStorage and querySelector are not part of Javascript lang. 
These are implemented by chrome run time. 
when chrome run a js file which has these methods, 
in the end of the day some C++ program is executed behind the scenes.

chrome tells v8 to do something when these methods are called. Chrome not only sending javascript code to v8
it also sends c++ code (C++ bindings - localStorage etc methods)to get the job done.

Same with node js.

Javascript (node js)   C++
fs.readFile             some c++ func.
os. platform            some c++ func.
Above methods are not part of javascript lang. also v8 does not understand them.
Those functionalities are implemented by node which is written in C++, 
when v8 excute js file with those methods. v8 diifers to node js c++ code to execute.
